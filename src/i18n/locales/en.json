My journey began in 2022, when I had my first contact with programming during a technical computing course. Since then, I’ve been continuously learning and growing as a developer, with around three years of study and two years of real-world experience. I enjoy understanding how things work behind the code and turning ideas into something functional and well structured. I’m always looking to improve, learning new technologies, refining my skills, and exploring different ways to solve problems simply and effectively."
